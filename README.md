# Tableau_Assignment
For my Tableau homework, I noticed several trends.

The Total Number of Trips recorded for September 2013 was 1,034,359.

I wanted to analyze the most active hours in September. The hours with the most activity are 5:00pm with a count of 104,913 riders. It appears that 5:00pm is when the most riders are active. There is a minor peak at 8:00am with a downward trend at 9:00am. Rider activity begins to pick up at 10:00am.

W 20th St & 11th Ave is the most active station where riders begins their trips.
E 17th St & Broadway is the most active station where riders end their trips.

W 20th St & 11th Ave, E 17th & Broadway, Lafayette St and E 8th St, & 8th Ave & W 31st St are the most common start and end stations for riders.
